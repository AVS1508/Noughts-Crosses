# Noughts-Crosses

## About the Program

This is a simple game of noughts & crosses. The program uses a 3x3 matrix display of a two-dimensional character array to hold the game table. The game alternates between two players, and is concluded when one of the player manages to align his characters in a vertical column, horizontal row, or one of the two diagonals.
